    <h2>Blown to bits reflection 1.1.1</h2>
    <P>I do agree that computing is completely altering society. I believe that it is changing civilization to be more dependable on technology. It is truly amazing to see that almost every single person has something in their live that is computable. While technology is our future, it can also be our downfall. In the book Blown to Bits on chapter two it explains how technology can never be safe even if you take all the precautions necessary. Another issue brought up in chapter two is encryption. Encryption is a great way to transport data to one place while containing secretive or private material. The major issue with encryption is they are hard to break, therefore criminals or terrorists are able to use them to their advantages. There are multiple pros and cons, but it is way too late for technology to discontinue, because they will always be receiving better processing power, resolution, or even size.</p>

    <h2>Light Bot Reflection 1.1.2/3</h2>
    <P>I believe that the light bot game works almost just like a computer. With a computer you type words on the keyboard and the computer put the words on the monitor. With  the light bot  you can add certain commands then it will put out an action. Functions were made for both the light bot and computer chip to achieve certain functions. On the contrary, the they do differ in some ways. Like, how the light bot has a different less complicated code. Computers are used to complete many tasks while the light bot has one objective, light up a certain spaces that are dark. Another difference is how they acquire power. The light bot receives its power from the computer but the computer get its power from an outlet. Although they vary, their similarities prevail.</p>

    <p>1) It is a great idea to write a little bit of code at a time because if you put some down and it is wrong, you will be able to notice and fix your error.<P/>
    <p>2) In soccer when i'm trying something new it will usually take me a few times to get used to, this is just like coding in the way that it'll take me a few times just to write a small amount of code. Practice makes perfect and that goes for everything, not just coding and sports.<P/>
    <p>3) Dual-core computers can run 10 programs at once because they have better processing powers by using more complicated code and that makes it an overall better computer to work on.<P/>

    <P>1)  It helps to have multiple code in certain sections because if a whole bunch of code is all in one sprite it is much easier to miss an error or confuse the computer.<p/>
    <p>2)  Events are the program and coding when you press a button it will cause an action, the actions are then handled and processed by computing.<p/>
    <p> 3)  a. Just like a car the motor, that is the power source, is encapsulated or hidden under the hood. The code “Playg()” can be compared to a motor because the user can only see what action occurs when the pedal is pressed or in this matter a green flag.<p/>
    <p>     b. It would be more convenient if programmers really made their code stand out and  easier to read, this would then allow people to tinker their code to the way they want it.

    <p>1) Using fixed variables help all programmers to posses less errors in their final code. The programmer may fail to use the right number unless they use a variable. It also helps if coders to have a variable representing a number like direction, so that would allow them to change one number instead of all the ones they were using.<p/>
    <p>2) If the letter “g” is pressed by the user then the total goal accumulator will change by 1. If not pressed by the user then nothing will change<p/>
    <p>3) A. The accumulator can be used for various projects like a score on a scoreboard, or even a calculator<p/>
    <p>   B. A score accumulator can be used to add each point for football. Football scores can get harder and harder to add when the teams just keep scoring, while like soccer a person would only have to add one point each goal.<p/>
    <p>4) The accumulator uses addition all the points that are typed in the code, while the aggregator is a list that will show all the points that were scored.<p/>

    <p>Me and my partner, Haley Mitchell, coded a program containing a series of mazes, by using the language Scratch. The entire game is Halloween themed and two dimensional. The player is able to control the sprite by using their arrows on their keyboard. Level one or maze one is played by a flame and it is attempting to reach a candle by going through a generally easy maze. Once the flame reaches the end of the maze it will hit a sprite of a candle and then change to level two. There are a total of three levels and they all work the same, but the levels will get progressively more difficult. The objective is to get the lit jack-o-lantern back to its owner which is the the headless horseman. <p/>

     <h2>App Inventor Reflection 1.2.2</h2>
  <p>1)	Scratch also has a combination of a GUI designer. The GUI designer in scratch 	is the most prominent action done on scratch. There are parts of the program on scratch that are hidden from user eye like its binary code.<p/>
  <p>2)	I believe there would be more of a variety and creativity from each cellular device, if anyone was allowed to code their phone. There would be more people with content emotions because they would be able to change their phones code how they would like it. <p/>
   <HR WIDTH="100%">
     <h2>App Inventor Reflection 1.2.3</h2>
  <p>1)	The App Inventor code is very similar to Scratch because of many reasons. One is how they look almost the exact same, another is how they are represented through blocks. Although they are both made by the college MIT, the different programs have variation. The App Inventor does not need the user to press a certain button to start the program, while on Scratch the user needs to press a green flag to start any of the code.<p/>
  <p>2)	Designing on a mobile phone is different from designing on a computer because they both contain contrasting actions. A mobile device is able to vibrate, change its orientation, reveals its position, or even detect how many steps a person takes, while a computer is not capable to accomplish these tasks.<p/>
