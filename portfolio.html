    <h2>Blown to bits reflection</h2>
    <P>I do agree that computing is completely altering society. I believe that it is changing civilization to be more dependable on technology. It is truly amazing to see that almost every single person has something in their live that is computable. While technology is our future, it can also be our downfall. In the book Blown to Bits on chapter two it explains how technology can never be safe even if you take all the precautions necessary. Another issue brought up in chapter two is encryption. Encryption is a great way to transport data to one place while containing secretive or private material. The major issue with encryption is they are hard to break, therefore criminals or terrorists are able to use them to their advantages. There are multiple pros and cons, but it is way too late for technology to discontinue, because they will always be receiving better processing power, resolution, or even size.</p>

    <h2>Light Bot Reflection</h2>
    <P>I believe that the light bot game works almost just like a computer. With a computer you type words on the keyboard and the computer put the words on the monitor. With  the light bot  you can add certain commands then it will put out an action. Functions were made for both the light bot and computer chip to achieve certain functions. On the contrary, the they do differ in some ways. Like, how the light bot has a different less complicated code. Computers are used to complete many tasks while the light bot has one objective, light up a certain spaces that are dark. Another difference is how they acquire power. The light bot receives its power from the computer but the computer get its power from an outlet. Although they vary, their similarities prevail.</p>

    <p>1) It is a great idea to write a little bit of code at a time because if you put some down and it is wrong, you will be able to notice and fix your error.<P/>
    <p>2) In soccer when i'm trying something new it will usually take me a few times to get used to, this is just like coding in the way that it'll take me a few times just to write a small amount of code. Practice makes perfect and that goes for everything, not just coding and sports.<P/>
    <p>3) Dual-core computers can run 10 programs at once because they have better processing powers by using more complicated code and that makes it an overall better computer to work on.<P/>
